Which these data contains so much personal contents like social number, credit card credentials  or personal mobile number etc . So protecting these data is one of the top priorty for the organizations and others. There are several methods to secure the data the most used common way is Encryption. Encryption is a process of protecting a data by using mathematical models to scramble it in a way such that both parties must have the unique key to unscramble the data. The key must be unique. There are two types of encryption **Symmetric encryption and Asymmetric encryption.**\n",

        "is also known as shared key or private key algorithm which uses the same key for encryption and also for the decryption of the data. **AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES(Data Encryption Standard) are two examples of symmetric encryption.** Asymmetric encrption are type of encryption which uses two keys for encryption and decryption. Which one key would be public anyone can use it to encrypt the data but only the holders of the private key can decrypt the message. **RSA and ECC(Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** are the two examples of asymmetric encryption. In this report we are going through all these methods, hash function and the **SHA-256(Secure Hash Algorithm).**"

        "\n",
        "Hashing algorithms and encryption are essential instruments for data security. Information is jumbled using a secret key during encryption, so only those with permission can decipher it. In contrast, hash functions provide distinct fingerprints, or hash values, for each piece of data, making it possible to efficiently verify the integrity of the data. Together, they make up a formidable team: hash functions verify the authenticity of data while encryption safeguards its confidentiality. These two components are essential for safe communication, data storage, and upholding public confidence in digital systems. The necessity will determine which technique is best: hash functions for data integrity verification and encryption for confidentiality.\n",
